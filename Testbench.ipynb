To put this distance into perspective, if Earth were the size of a pea, Sagittarius A* would be about 1,000 kilometers away, roughly the distance between New York City and Chicago.\\n\\nNow, let's delve into the mind-boggling characteristics of Sagittarius A*. This supermassive black hole has a mass equivalent to about 4 million times that of our Sun, compressed into a region smaller than the size of our solar system. Imagine packing the entire mass of 4 million Suns into an area smaller than the orbit of Neptune – that's the density and gravitational pull of Sagittarius A*.\\n\\nMoving on to TON 618, we shift our focus to a distant quasar located around 10.4 billion light-years away from Earth. This means that the light we see from TON 618 today actually started its journey towards us when the universe was much younger.\\n\\nTON 618 is one of the most massive black holes known, with a mass estimated to be around 66 billion times that of our Sun. To envision the sheer enormity of TON 618, imagine a black hole so massive that it would easily engulf the entire orbit of Neptune, our Solar System's outermost planet.\\n\\nIn summary, Sagittarius A* and TON 618 exemplify the extremes of the universe – from the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy to the colossal black hole residing billions of light-years away. These celestial giants serve as a reminder of the awe-inspiring vastness and diversity of the cosmos, inviting us to ponder the mysteries that lie beyond our earthly confines.\")]}"
