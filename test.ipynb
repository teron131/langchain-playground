       "'Folks, a once-in-a-lifetime event is \\n coming in 2026, and you need to consider \\n doing very specific things by December \\n 31st. Now, the setup for 2026 is \\n incredibly unusual, incredibly unique, \\n and incredibly opportune for those who \\n are paying attention. We\\'ve got fiscal \\n policy, monetary policy, and \\n deregulation working together in a way \\n that we really have never seen before. \\n at the same time where you have this \\n massive new technology AI that has taken \\n the world by storm and is set to draw in \\n trillions upon trillions of dollars \\n worth of capex. This video will break \\n down as follows. How the market is \\n setting up for 2026. The specific data \\n that points to what\\'s going on. Number \\n two, the top stocks that are set to \\n succeed in 2026. And of course, number \\n three, the checklist of seven things you \\n must do by December 31st. And then it\\'ll \\n be time for our sponsored segment on \\n Quantum Bioarma, ticker symbol Q&M on \\n the NASDAQ. a company with two potential \\n catalysts in their pipeline. A \\n breakthrough multiple sclerosis drug \\n that could actually repair damaged \\n nerves and a clinically proven \\n supplement that accelerates alcohol \\n metabolism. Both have completed clinical \\n trials with statistically significant \\n results. I\\'ll present the company and \\n why you may want to take a look at it. \\n And as always, if you\\'re the one taking \\n the ultimate risk, you got to be the one \\n doing the ultimate frisk. Always do your \\n own due diligence on all ideas \\n presented. Okay, let\\'s start with the \\n market. So, from Halloween through \\n today, AI trades have been trending \\n down. This is no surprise. We had a bit \\n of a resurgence towards the end of this \\n week, but the doom crowd is getting \\n louder and louder. And no matter what \\n happens into the end of the year, \\n whether we get a Santa Claus rally or a \\n Santa Claus collapse, well, people will \\n come out and say, \"This is an AI bubble, \\n and you must avoid it like the plague.\" \\n They\\'ll scream, \"Get out now with \\n everything you can. Go into cash.\" New \\n videos are popping up on the daily. \\n Brace yourself for the AI bubble. The \\n $25 trillion AI bubble is bursting. The \\n AI bubble is worse than you think. \\n Michael Bur\\'s new warning about AI \\n stocks. Big tech\\'s AI debt will crash \\n the economy. Lots of doom, lots of \\n gloom, lots of bubble whispering. Now, \\n eventually all market cycles end. So, of \\n course, all of these predictions will \\n eventually be correct. The market can \\n crash tomorrow or can crash in 5 to 10 \\n years from now. But at the end of the \\n day, these people can say, \"We called it \\n out.\" And that\\'s fine. And it\\'s \\n important to understand risks, right? \\n But if you\\'re an investor or a trader or \\n a stock market conscientious observer, \\n well, it\\'s actually pretty damn \\n important to understand the details and \\n the nuances and the actual context of \\n what\\'s going on. It\\'s important to \\n actually understand what\\'s driving the \\n market because let\\'s face it, if you\\'re \\n out of the market every time somebody \\n else bubble or somebody else crash \\n coming, well, you never be in the market \\n at all. Most people make financial \\n decisions based on fear, they don\\'t have \\n any interest really in the long-term \\n bigger picture. They might be interested \\n in the long-term bigger picture when \\n things are going straight up. But the \\n minute that there\\'s any kind of red day, \\n they start thinking fear, fear, fear, \\n fear. And they think to themselves, I\\'d \\n rather stop myself from having a couple \\n dollars worth of volatility today versus \\n the potential to make thousands of \\n dollars tomorrow. And again, it\\'s \\n important to talk about risks. Markets \\n are cyclical, but you got to make sure \\n that you understand what\\'s really going \\n on. So, what\\'s really been going on with \\n this massive AI sell-off? The main thing \\n that I see repeated again and again and \\n again is the financing. People are \\n worried that AI is going to run out of \\n financing. They worry there\\'s going to \\n be a big cash shortage and eventually \\n everything will collapse because of \\n that. People are asking the reasonable \\n question, can the AI industry afford to \\n keep building? And when will they stop \\n being able to afford that? The reality \\n is that building out AI infrastructure \\n is expensive. We\\'re talking data \\n centers, GPU clusters, power \\n infrastructure, cooling systems, the \\n whole nine yards. Very, very expensive. \\n And a lot of it has to be replaced every \\n few years. Hyperscaler capex for 2025 is \\n expected to hit somewhere around $320 \\n billion. We\\'ll see the final numbers in \\n a couple weeks. For 2026, we\\'re looking \\n at projections between 520 and $530 \\n billion. That\\'s over half a trillion in \\n a single year. that money\\'s going \\n somewhere and it\\'s causing a lot of \\n stocks to go up huge as they receive \\n these massive orders. So where has this \\n money been coming from? Well, number \\n one, cash financing. So your Metas, your \\n Alphabets, and your Microsoft taking \\n their massive free cash flow and \\n deploying it directly into data center \\n buildouts. This leg here was never \\n stressed. These companies print money. \\n They\\'re sitting on war chests. They\\'re \\n absolutely fine. Number two, debt \\n financing. This is where companies issue \\n bonds to raise capital. And this has \\n started showing some cracks recently. \\n Oracle, who\\'s been the ring leader of \\n debt finance data center expansion, \\n tried multiple bond sales over the last \\n few months that did not go well for \\n them. Bond values are dropping and the \\n debt markets were essentially saying, \\n \"We\\'re getting nervous about this.\" And \\n then number three, you\\'ve got private \\n equity financing. These are your private \\n capital firms like Blue Owl putting up \\n money for massive data center projects. \\n And this started showing stress, too. \\n There was a reported $10 billion data \\n center project in Michigan tied to \\n OpenAI that Blue Owl was supposed to \\n finance and they reportedly pulled back. \\n Deal got stuck in limbo. So essentially \\n what you had is two of these three \\n financing legs start wobbling and you \\n had the Fed going back and forth with \\n whether or not they were going to cut \\n rates too, which was a whole another \\n problem. But when these legs start \\n wobbling, what happens? Markets panic. \\n That\\'s why AI stock sold off. Not \\n because AI is dead, not because AI has \\n run out of money, but because there was \\n some wobbling in terms of the financing. \\n But now the financing is starting to \\n improve quite a lot. Not only is the Fed \\n going very very doubbish in 2026, but \\n the financing picture and the two \\n wobbling legs has gotten a lot stronger. \\n Reports came out first from the \\n information on Wednesday, then confirmed \\n by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday \\n that OpenAI is looking to raise up to \\n $100 billion. This would be the largest \\n private fundraising round in history. \\n The second largest was OpenAI\\'s $40 \\n billion raise just earlier this year. \\n You get these hundred billion plus \\n raises. That means that the true \\n valuation of some of these companies is \\n being valued at way way more than \\n markets had expected and creates these \\n situations where these companies are \\n going to be able to get lots and lots of \\n money through financing and through \\n other capital raise structures. Think \\n about this. The terms of this raise \\n reportedly would put OpenAI at about a \\n $830 billion valuation. And here\\'s what \\n you need to understand about this. When \\n you\\'re talking about a hundred billion \\n private raise, this isn\\'t coming from \\n your typical small VCs. This is \\n sovereign wealth fund type of money. \\n We\\'re talking Saudi Arabia\\'s PIF fund. \\n We\\'re talking the UAE. We\\'re even \\n talking about Norway\\'s pension fund. And \\n that means that at the end of this week, \\n the financing tap that a lot of people \\n worried about, well, it opened much, \\n much wider. And this is going to have \\n massive downstream effects. You have to \\n remember the AI buildout is a race. It\\'s \\n a race between nations. It\\'s a race \\n between hyperscalers. It\\'s a race for \\n compute dominance. And when you have \\n these sovereign wealth funds and other \\n big money players around the world \\n pouring fresh hundreds of billions into \\n AI, well that means that a lot of the \\n concerns about financing sustainability, \\n fears about whether we can even afford \\n to have the AI buildout that is \\n necessary to dominate while all these \\n fears get evaporated. Because here\\'s the \\n thing, folks, this isn\\'t just about open \\n AI getting funded. These types of deals \\n as they come in signal to the entire \\n market that sovereign capital is all in \\n on AI infrastructure and that changes \\n the risk calculus for everyone. Now you \\n combine this with the overall situation. \\n You have a Federal Reserve that has \\n turned the money printer back on that is \\n in the middle of a rate cutting cycle. \\n You have a White House that wants to cut \\n every regulation under the sun to make \\n sure that AI can dominate in the United \\n States. You have an overall situation \\n where both the central bank and the \\n federal government love to destroy the \\n currency and throw money everywhere. You \\n have a situation where private investors \\n and companies with their massive balance \\n sheets are very very much motivated and \\n dedicated to spending on AI capex. and \\n you have this overall AI arms race. \\n Well, you put all this together and it \\n makes it very very difficult to believe \\n that the AI expenditure is all of a \\n sudden going to collapse. Now, what does \\n this mean for you practically? So, these \\n are the sectors that you should pay \\n attention to. Number one, AI \\n infrastructure. These are the second \\n order plays that are going to really, \\n really perform well in 2026 in my view. \\n You know, everyone knows Nvidia, \\n everyone knows the hyperscalers. They\\'re \\n great companies, but look, the trade is \\n getting more and more crowded. The real \\n money in terms of percentage up \\n potential is going to be in the picks \\n and shovels behind these picks and \\n shovels. The power bottleneck is \\n absolutely massive. Global power demand \\n from data centers will increase 165% by \\n the end of the decade. Power demand from \\n AI data centers could grow 30fold by \\n 2035. You cannot build AI infrastructure \\n without power. If you can\\'t plug in the \\n GPUs, they\\'re basically expensive paper \\n weights, right? And then there\\'s the \\n sleeper angle, which is transmission. \\n It\\'s not a generation problem. It\\'s a \\n transmission problem. from 12 years of \\n transmission buildouts effectively makes \\n some locations unavailable for AI \\n infrastructure. The AI arms race is \\n happening now. Companies can\\'t wait 12 \\n years, so they\\'re going to pay up for \\n solutions. So where is the money going \\n to flow? Power and utilities. For \\n starters, utilities are shifting from a \\n defensive yield play into a hybrid \\n income plus secular growth sector. 21 \\n utility providers mentioned data centers \\n in Q4 2023. Earnings calls versus just \\n three in 2021. And then you have grid \\n equipment. The bottleneck is \\n transformers, gas interconnections, \\n medium voltage, gear, and permitting. \\n These are backorded for years with \\n massive pricing power. And then you have \\n cooling. 35 to 40% of hyperscaler energy \\n consumption is from cooling. Liquid \\n cooling wins regardless of which AI \\n model wins. Networking by 2026. The \\n network will define AI performance. The \\n real limiter won\\'t be GPUs, but \\n interconnects across the entire AI \\n system. Number two, financials. This is \\n the most underappreciated sector heading \\n into 2026. But financials boast \\n resilient earnings and differentiated \\n catalysts like deregulation and yield \\n curve steepening. The catalyst stack \\n here. Well, the Fed is cutting rates \\n which is going to help margin stabilize. \\n The yield curve is normalizing. \\n Deregulation is reducing compliance \\n costs a lot. And M&A and IPO pipelines \\n are reopening. Those are big money \\n drivers for financial companies. And \\n when rates go down, well, all of a \\n sudden, M&As and IPOs start going, start \\n getting very, very popular again. Number \\n three, healthcare. This is a turnaround \\n setup. Healthc care has been a dog, a \\n down dog for three years. That\\'s exactly \\n why I\\'m interested. Healthcare stocks \\n have become deeply discounted. Relative \\n valuations are at multi-deade lows \\n versus the S&P 500. But this coming \\n year, you\\'re going to want to pay \\n attention to three different sectors. \\n Yo, the biotech M&A wave. Nearly half of \\n publicly traded biotech companies were \\n trading below cash on their balance \\n sheets. Meanwhile, pharma has $1 \\n trillion in cash reserves and needs to \\n replace hundreds of billions of dollars \\n in expiring patent revenues. GLP-1 \\n explosion. 120 plus nextg GLP-1 drugs \\n are in development across 60 companies. \\n Market is projected to hit 100 billion \\n dollars by 2030. One to two GLP-1 \\n launches annually are going to be \\n happening starting in 2026. Pay \\n attention to small midcap biotech. Pay \\n attention to diversified pharma with \\n pipeline optionality. Pay attention to \\n healthcare IT with recurring revenue. In \\n terms of criteria that you should look \\n for when it comes to buying stocks for \\n 2026, look for sticky software plays \\n with 110% plus net retention and \\n positive free cash flow. Look for AI \\n second order plays, power, cooling, \\n networking, not first order hype that \\n has already been run up a lot. Look for \\n turnarounds with real catalyst, biotech, \\n M&A, and regional banks that could catch \\n up. And look for balance sheets that are \\n under 2.5x net debt over Ebatop. The \\n bottom line is there\\'s going to be a lot \\n of opportunities next year, but you want \\n to buy quality. The three Q\\'s, quality, \\n quality, quality. A lot of people say, \\n \"Charlie, I don\\'t want quality, quality, \\n quality. I want the three H\\'s. Hype, \\n hype, hype.\" Okay, so what should we \\n consider doing by December 31st? First, \\n clean up your portfolio. No more hold \\n and hope positions. This is a big one. \\n Before the calendar flips, you need to \\n go stock by stock and ask yourself, if I \\n didn\\'t own this today, would I buy it \\n right now to hold for the next 3 to 5 \\n years? If the answer is no, you already \\n know what to do. Let me be very clear. \\n Holding and hoping is not a strategy. \\n Dead money kills your portfolio. Do not \\n allow dead money to stay in your \\n portfolio. If you don\\'t believe in the \\n future of a company anymore, you got to \\n just say, you know what, it\\'s time to \\n move on. Sometimes selling a stock at a \\n loss is simply a cost of doing business. \\n Okay. Second, think smart about taxes \\n and tax loss harvesting. So, at the end \\n of the year, a lot of people start \\n thinking about tax loss harvesting. \\n Essentially, selling their losing \\n positions to offset their gains from \\n winning positions that they took profits \\n on. This is a great strategy if you\\'re \\n selling stocks that no longer have your \\n conviction. But what I see is a lot of \\n people will go and they\\'ll sell great \\n stocks that they do have long-term \\n conviction in simply because they\\'re \\n down. This is a really dumb strategy \\n because a lot of times what happens is \\n you\\'re going to sell it. You\\'re going to \\n be able to cancel out some of your gains \\n in other stocks and then that stock that \\n you had a long-term conviction in goes \\n up a lot the next year and you end up \\n buying in much higher and then all of a \\n sudden that stock\\'s down again. Three, \\n commit to investing long-term in your \\n high conviction stocks. There are so \\n many people that started the year panic \\n buying, then panic selling, then panic \\n buying, then panic selling, then panic \\n buying, and now for the last couple \\n months have been panic selling again. \\n They sold because of headlines, \\n politics, fear, whatever it is. And \\n guess what? If you had just held many of \\n those stocks are up 50%, 100%, 200%, \\n even 300%. Many stocks that we\\'ve talked \\n about are up those numbers. So, what\\'s \\n the lesson here? Well, simply holding \\n high conviction stocks is your ticket to \\n success. If market moves are stressing \\n you out, well, it\\'s probably true that \\n you\\'re overtrading. you\\'re overthinking \\n or you simply don\\'t actually believe in \\n what you own. All of these things are \\n fixable very very easily. Fifth, know \\n where strength will be in 2026. 2026 is \\n not going to reward everything equally. \\n Again, things I\\'d be thinking about \\n sticky software businesses, AI second \\n order plays, not just hype plays, \\n turnarounds where fundamentals are \\n improving, balance sheets that can \\n handle everything. Things I\\'d be \\n cautious with, extreme valuation \\n momentum stocks, narrative only stories, \\n heavy debt plus uncertain cash flows, \\n stocks priced like nothing can go wrong. \\n 2026 again is not about hype, it\\'s about \\n execution. Number six, be prepared for \\n all outcomes. Going into 2026, you \\n should be okay if the market grinds \\n higher, if the market goes sideways, if \\n the market drops 20%. That means no \\n forceelling, no leverage stress. You\\'re \\n not going crazy up to your eyeballs and \\n margin, some dry powder on the \\n sidelines, and emotional control. \\n Markets could go higher, markets could \\n grind sideways, markets can go down, \\n markets can do all three of those within \\n the same year. So, be prepared for all \\n market outcomes and you\\'re going to be \\n coming out ahead. Seventh, and most \\n importantly, think bigger picture, \\n please. You cannot think short- term \\n going into 2026. If you\\'re trying to buy \\n companies that are investing into AI and \\n you think they need to be profitable \\n today with these investments, well, you \\n are not going to be doing well because \\n none of the companies that are trying to \\n make short-term profits are going to be \\n big winners in the long term. It\\'s also \\n important not to get yourself caught up \\n in short-term fluctuations and \\n short-term noise. 2026 is a very \\n important time to be prepared, and I \\n think these seven steps are going to \\n help you a lot with that. That\\'s how you \\n win before 2026 even starts, and I\\'m \\n looking forward to being with you every \\n step of the way. Anyways, that caps off \\n this section of the video. Now, it\\'s \\n time for our sponsored segment. And in \\n today\\'s sponsored segment, we\\'re talking \\n about Quantum Bioarma, which is a \\n biioharmaceutical company trading on the \\n NASDAQ under ticker symbol Q&M. They\\'re \\n focused on neurodeenerative disorders, \\n metabolic disorders, and alcohol misuse. \\n We\\'re going to explain why you may want \\n to put this one on your radar as soon as \\n possible and begin your due diligence. \\n Okay, so they\\'ve got two main value \\n drivers right now. Number one is the \\n Lucid MS, their lead compound targeting \\n multiple sclerosis. Number two is \\n Unbuzzed, a dietary supplement that \\n accelerates alcohol metabolism, which \\n they\\'ve spun out to a separate company \\n while retaining equity and royalties. \\n Now, here\\'s what I want you to \\n understand about their structure. So, \\n they\\'re not just burning cash on R&D \\n with nothing to show for it. They\\'ve \\n completed phase one clinical trials for \\n Lucid MS with with positive safety data. \\n They\\'ve completed a rigorous clinical \\n trial for Unbuzz with statistically \\n significant results and they\\'ve got \\n strategic investments generating cash \\n flow while they advance their pipeline. \\n But let\\'s start with the opportunity \\n with Lucid MS. Multiple sclerosis \\n affects nearly 3 million people \\n worldwide and that number is sadly \\n growing. In 2013, global prevalence was \\n 2.3 million. By 2020, it hit 2.8 \\n million. This is a massive and expanding \\n market. Now, here\\'s what you need to \\n understand about MS. It\\'s a chronic \\n disease where your immune system attacks \\n the myelin\\'s sheath. That\\'s the \\n protective coating around your nerve \\n fibers in your brain and spinal cord. \\n When myelin gets damaged, your nerves \\n can\\'t communicate properly. That\\'s why \\n MS patients experience symptoms like \\n vision problems, mobility issues, \\n tingling sensations, cognitive decline, \\n the whole range. Now, here\\'s the problem \\n with current MS treatments. Almost all \\n of them are immuno modulatory, meaning \\n they work by suppressing your immune \\n system to slow down the attack on \\n myelin. But they don\\'t actually repair \\n the damage. They don\\'t reverse \\n demiination. They just try to slow it \\n down while compromising your immune \\n function. Lucid MS takes a completely \\n different approach. It\\'s what they call \\n a non-immunodatory \\n neuroprotective compound. Instead of \\n suppressing your immune system, it\\'s \\n designed to directly stabilize and \\n protect myelin. In pre-clinical models, \\n we\\'re talking multiple studies across \\n several labs over 11 years. Lucidms MS \\n has shown the ability to not just \\n prevent myelin degradation, but actually \\n reverse it. They published this research \\n in peer-review journals including the \\n journal of medicinal chemistry at and \\n PNAS. Now where are they in development? \\n They completed their phase one multiple \\n ascending dose clinical trial earlier \\n this year. The safety review committee \\n found that lucid MS was well tolerated \\n with no safety concerns and no serious \\n adverse events. That\\'s exactly what you \\n want to see from a phase one. They\\'ve \\n also completed their 90-day oral \\n toxicity study and toxioinetic studies \\n which are key requirements for their FDA \\n investigational new drug application. \\n They\\'re actively working towards phase 2 \\n efficacy trials in actual MS patients. \\n Now, let\\'s talk about the second piece \\n of the puzzle, which is Unbuzzed. This \\n is a dietary supplement developed by \\n Quantum Bioarma scientific team that\\'s \\n designed to accelerate alcohol \\n metabolism. Now, I know what you\\'re \\n thinking, Charlie, there are a thousand \\n hangover cures out there. What makes \\n this different? Well, what makes it \\n different is they actually ran a real \\n clinical trial. We\\'re talking a double \\n blind randomized placeboc controlled \\n crossover study. That\\'s the gold \\n standard for clinical research. They \\n registered it with clinicaltrials.gov, \\n the whole nine yards. And the results \\n were striking. Study participants who \\n took unbuzzed after drinking saw their \\n blood alcohol concentration drop more \\n than 40% faster than the placebo group \\n within just 30 minutes. That\\'s not a \\n marginal improvement. That\\'s a dramatic \\n acceleration in alcohol metabolism. But \\n it wasn\\'t just BAC levels. Participants \\n also showed rapid improvements in \\n alertness, reductions in perceived \\n impairment and mental fatigue. And \\n here\\'s the one everyone cares about, \\n significantly reduced hangover symptoms. \\n We\\'re talking a 67% reduction in \\n headache severity at the 4-hour mark \\n compared to placebo. And importantly, no \\n adverse side effects were reported. Now, \\n here\\'s how the business model works. \\n Quantum Bioarma invented Unbuzzed and \\n then licensed the OTC consumer version \\n to a company called Selling Nutrition, \\n now called Unbuzzed Wellness. Quantum \\n Bioarma retains around a 20% equity \\n stake in that company, plus royalty \\n payments of 7% on all sales until \\n payments reach $250 million, and then \\n that drops to 3% in perpetuity. So they \\n get equity upside, they get ongoing \\n royalties, and they retain 100% of the \\n rights to develop pharmaceutical \\n versions for medical and hospital \\n settings. Now, of course, again, this is \\n a sponsored segment, and this is a small \\n cap stock. It\\'s also biotech, which \\n biotech is very, very high risk \\n inherently. Clinical trials fail all the \\n time. Small cap biotechs can be \\n extremely volatile. We\\'re talking big \\n swings in both directions. And of \\n course, as always, you got to make sure \\n that you\\'re doing your own due diligence \\n and coming to your own conclusion. But \\n anyways, if you want to learn more about \\n Quantum Bioarma, their pipeline, their \\n upcoming catalyst, and so on and so \\n forth, I\\'ll put the link to them in the \\n description down below. Ticker symbol \\n QNTM on the NASDAQ. Anyways, folks, that \\n caps off today\\'s video. Have a great \\n rest of your day. We\\'ll see you next \\n time.'"

      " multiple sclerosis. Number two is \n",
      " Unbuzzed, a dietary supplement that \n",
      " accelerates alcohol metabolism, which \n",
      " they've spun out to a separate company \n",
      " while retaining equity and royalties. \n",
      " Now, here's what I want you to \n",
      " understand about their structure. So, \n",
      " they're not just burning cash on R&D \n",
      " with nothing to show for it. They've \n",
      " completed phase one clinical trials for \n",
      " Lucid MS with with positive safety data. \n",
      " They've completed a rigorous clinical \n",
      " trial for Unbuzz with statistically \n",
      " significant results and they've got \n",
      " strategic investments generating cash \n",
      " flow while they advance their pipeline. \n",
      " But let's start with the opportunity \n",
      " with Lucid MS. Multiple sclerosis \n",
      " affects nearly 3 million people \n",
      " worldwide and that number is sadly \n",
      " growing. In 2013, global prevalence was \n",
      " 2.3 million. By 2020, it hit 2.8 \n",
      " million. This is a massive and expanding \n",
      " market. Now, here's what you need to \n",
      " understand about MS. It's a chronic \n",
      " disease where your immune system attacks \n",
      " the myelin's sheath. That's the \n",
      " protective coating around your nerve \n",
      " fibers in your brain and spinal cord. \n",
      " When myelin gets damaged, your nerves \n",
      " can't communicate properly. That's why \n",
      " MS patients experience symptoms like \n",
      " vision problems, mobility issues, \n",
      " tingling sensations, cognitive decline, \n",
      " the whole range. Now, here's the problem \n",
      " with current MS treatments. Almost all \n",
      " of them are immuno modulatory, meaning \n",
      " they work by suppressing your immune \n",
      " system to slow down the attack on \n",
      " myelin. But they don't actually repair \n",
      " the damage. They don't reverse \n",
      " demiination. They just try to slow it \n",
      " down while compromising your immune \n",
      " function. Lucid MS takes a completely \n",
      " different approach. It's what they call \n",
      " a non-immunodatory \n",
      " neuroprotective compound. Instead of \n",
      " suppressing your immune system, it's \n",
      " designed to directly stabilize and \n",
      " protect myelin. In pre-clinical models, \n",
      " we're talking multiple studies across \n",
      " several labs over 11 years. Lucidms MS \n",
      " has shown the ability to not just \n",
      " prevent myelin degradation, but actually \n",
      " reverse it. They published this research \n",
      " in peer-review journals including the \n",
      " journal of medicinal chemistry at and \n",
      " PNAS. Now where are they in development? \n",
      " They completed their phase one multiple \n",
      " ascending dose clinical trial earlier \n",
      " this year. The safety review committee \n",
      " found that lucid MS was well tolerated \n",
      " with no safety concerns and no serious \n",
      " adverse events. That's exactly what you \n",
      " want to see from a phase one. They've \n",
      " also completed their 90-day oral \n",
      " toxicity study and toxioinetic studies \n",
      " which are key requirements for their FDA \n",
      " investigational new drug application. \n",
      " They're actively working towards phase 2 \n",
      " efficacy trials in actual MS patients. \n",
      " Now, let's talk about the second piece \n",
      " of the puzzle, which is Unbuzzed. This \n",
      " is a dietary supplement developed by \n",
      " Quantum Bioarma scientific team that's \n",
      " designed to accelerate alcohol \n",
      " metabolism. Now, I know what you're \n",
      " thinking, Charlie, there are a thousand \n",
      " hangover cures out there. What makes \n",
      " this different? Well, what makes it \n",
      " different is they actually ran a real \n",
      " clinical trial. We're talking a double \n",
      " blind randomized placeboc controlled \n",
      " crossover study. That's the gold \n",
      " standard for clinical research. They \n",
      " registered it with clinicaltrials.gov, \n",
      " the whole nine yards. And the results \n",
      " were striking. Study participants who \n",
      " took unbuzzed after drinking saw their \n",
      " blood alcohol concentration drop more \n",
      " than 40% faster than the placebo group \n",
      " within just 30 minutes. That's not a \n",
      " marginal improvement. That's a dramatic \n",
      " acceleration in alcohol metabolism. But \n",
      " it wasn't just BAC levels. Participants \n",
      " also showed rapid improvements in \n",
      " alertness, reductions in perceived \n",
      " impairment and mental fatigue. And \n",
      " here's the one everyone cares about, \n",
      " significantly reduced hangover symptoms. \n",
      " We're talking a 67% reduction in \n",
      " headache severity at the 4-hour mark \n",
      " compared to placebo. And importantly, no \n",
      " adverse side effects were reported. Now, \n",
      " here's how the business model works. \n",
      " Quantum Bioarma invented Unbuzzed and \n",
      " then licensed the OTC consumer version \n",
      " to a company called Selling Nutrition, \n",
      " now called Unbuzzed Wellness. Quantum \n",
      " Bioarma retains around a 20% equity \n",
      " stake in that company, plus royalty \n",
      " payments of 7% on all sales until \n",
      " payments reach $250 million, and then \n",
      " that drops to 3% in perpetuity. So they \n",
      " get equity upside, they get ongoing \n",
      " royalties, and they retain 100% of the \n",
      " rights to develop pharmaceutical \n",
      " versions for medical and hospital \n",
      " settings. Now, of course, again, this is \n",
      " a sponsored segment, and this is a small \n",
      " cap stock. It's also biotech, which \n",
      " biotech is very, very high risk \n",
      " inherently. Clinical trials fail all the \n",
      " time. Small cap biotechs can be \n",
      " extremely volatile. We're talking big \n",
      " swings in both directions. And of \n",
      " course, as always, you got to make sure \n",
      " that you're doing your own due diligence \n",
      " and coming to your own conclusion. But \n",
      " anyways, if you want to learn more about \n",
      " Quantum Bioarma, their pipeline, their \n",
      " upcoming catalyst, and so on and so \n",
      " forth, I'll put the link to them in the \n",
      " description down below. Ticker symbol \n",
      " QNTM on the NASDAQ. Anyways, folks, that \n",
      " caps off today's video. Have a great \n",
      " rest of your day. We'll see you next \n",
